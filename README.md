## Variables and observations
survival:	(0 = No, 1 = Yes)
pclass:	Ticket class	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
sex	
Age: (years)	
sibsp: number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch: number of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket:	Ticket number	
fare:	Passenger fare	
cabin:	Cabin number	
embarked:	Port of Embarkation	(C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

There have 1043 observations in the data set.

## Procedure
•	Create a model with apporpriate explanatory variable and use machine learning methods to tune the model.

•	Manipulate the data by cleaning, merging, and selecting relational variables via R.

•	Check the diagnostic, assumption, and transform the data via the EDA of each machine learning method.

•	Use ten-fold validation to tune the data and compare the results of Logistic, LASSO, Ridge, LDA, and Tree regression (random forest, decision tree). 

## Results
•	Impact- expect > 80% of stability and accuracy in multiple machine learning prediction models.
